          nature of professional websites and the sterile curation that
          goes into them. I hope it adds a sense of genuinity to my website
          to include. It's the shaq sleeping meme where the top half is the
          caption 'building a website to convey a curated professional
          appearance' with shaq sleeping and it says I sleep. The bottom
          half has the caption 'bottom text' indicating the nature of the
          meme can be gleaned from the top text alone, and it has a picture
          of shaq with his eyes glowing and it says 'real shit'. Your welcome"
